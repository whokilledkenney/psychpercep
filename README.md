## Linear Models
The General Linear Model (GLM) underlies most of the statistical analyses that are used in applied and social research. It is the foundation for the t-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), regression analysis, and many of the multivariate methods including factor analysis, cluster analysis, and others. Because of its generality, the model is important for students of social research.
